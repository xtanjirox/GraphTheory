# GraphTheory

In this repo we will cover the graph theory and implement the different algorithms used in this field of computer science, the major implementation will be using python for forst tests and C++ to learn this awsom language ;)<br>

This repo will be based on this youtube video, which I found more than enough to understaind Graphs and their algos : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09_LlHjoEiY
